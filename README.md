<h2>About Our Hackathon Journey</h2>
<p>Lori's original idea was to code a "History of Python" Quiz, but by Friday night (first day of hackathon), had lost interest in the project.</p>
<p>Lori and her daughter, AeryPear, decided to team up to develop a platformer game in Godot. Lori wrote the code while AeryPear created the assets. Almost all art in the game was created by Aerypear, as well as the background music, game over, and level complete jingles.</p>
<p>Level 1 was designed by Lori. Level 2 was designed by AeryPear.</p>
<p>The team got very little sleep over the course of the weekend, but we had fun fleshing out the beginnings of a game we hope to continue working on long after the event is over. There are so many ideas we had for features and game mechanics, but there just wasn't enough time to include them.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy testing and playing our creation and would love to hear your feedback!</p>
